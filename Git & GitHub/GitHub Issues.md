# GitHub Issues & Best Practises 
- GitHub Issues is a lightweight issue-tracking system that is available in all GitHub repositories. When you create a GitHub repo, you get GitHub Issues out of the box, and 
more often than not, you keep using it as your project evolves.
- In most cases, GitHub Issues is used for reporting bugs and requesting features. Sometimes it hosts discussions, helps process support requests, or even submit documentation 
feedback.

### Best Practice 1: If Youâ€™re Just Starting, Go With the Defaults
- If your repository is brand-new, you don't have a lot of issues reported, and you want to enable all kinds and forms of feedback to flow in, just keep the default settings 
for your GitHub Issues.
- You will be able to interact with users freely without limiting what they can report and have insightful discussions that may not necessarily be actionable. This could be a 
good idea in the early stages of your project when you're still getting a feel for your users and the problems they face.

### Best Practice 2: Encourage Search to Avoid Duplication
